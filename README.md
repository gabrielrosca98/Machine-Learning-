# Machine-Learning
My collection of Machine Learning programs developed during my second year at The University of Manchester. I continue to add new models and data analysis projects. Constantly looking forward to develop new skills in Data Science and Machine Learning domains.
Although first few programs were written in MATLAB, I will focus on using Python.
